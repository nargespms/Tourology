## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v14+ recommended)
- **npm**
- **Expo** (for running the React Native app)

### Running the client:

From the Client directory, run the following command:

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

- This will open the Expo Dev Tools in your console.
- Use an iOS or Android emulator, or scan the QR code with the Expo app on your device to run on a physical device.
